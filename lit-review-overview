# Literature Review Notes

## Broad Notes

The literature review could look at research in several different areas:
  1. Research in predicting traits from digital footprints.
  2. Research done into the determinants of ideology.
  3. Research into classification/learning techniques for sparse, high dimensional datasets (obviously we are not coming up with new techniques but these might guide good models).
  4. Research into NLP techniques to gauge political sentiment (again, in order to find techniques to apply to the second stage of the project).
  5. Research on how different ideologies respond to different sorts of events (to see if our results cohere or not).
